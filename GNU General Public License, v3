The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your 
freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: 
(1) assert copyright on the software, and 
(2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that 
modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow:

/* TERMS AND CONDITIONS: */

1) Definations
2) Source Code
3) Basic Permission
4) Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law
5) Conveying Verbatim Copies

7) Conveying Non-Source Forms
8) Additional Terms
9) Termination
10) Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies
11) Automation Licensing of Downstream Recipients

14) Use with the GNU Affero General Public License
